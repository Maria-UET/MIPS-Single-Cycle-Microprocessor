# MIPS-Single-Cycle-Microprocessor
This project is meant to describe Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages (MIPS) in Verilog. My project uses only some of the R, J and I type instructions employed in MIPS single cycle.  
Following is the instruction set for MIPS: 
(a) R Type: add, sub, or, xor, and, slt, sltu, jr.
(b) I Type: addi, ori, andi, slti, lw, sw, beq, bneq.
(c) J Type: j.
A reference for different machine code fields corresponding to different instructions is given in WIKIPEDIA: MIPS Assembly Reference
